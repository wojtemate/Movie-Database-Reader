# Movie-Database-Reader

This is my first project in Java.
It's a simple app allowing to read information about movies saved in Movies.txt file

Type the command to do an action: 
'help' to print all possible commands with explanations,
'categories' to print categories of movies in base,
'sorted by name' to print all movies titles sorted alphabetically,
'sorted by release date' to print list of movies sorted by release date,
'sorted by rate' to print list of movies sorted by rate,
'category filtered' to see list of movies in chosen category,
'end' to quit.
